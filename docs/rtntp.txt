                            R-Type Network Protocol
                                   (rtntp)

Abstract

   This document specifies the R-Type Network Protocol (rtntp), a UDP-based
   application-layer protocol designed for low-latency real-time applications
   such as multiplayer games. The protocol provides connection-oriented
   features over connectionless UDP, including session management, optional
   reliability and strict ordering.

Status of This Memo

   This document does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.
   Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

1.  Introduction

   rtntp is designed to provide a lightweight abstraction over User Datagram
   Protocol (UDP) [RFC768], offering configurable reliability and ordering
   guarantees per packet. It employs a header-based framing mechanism to manage
   sequence numbers, acknowledgments, and channel separation.

   The protocol is designed to be resistant to packet loss, duplication, and
   reordering, making it suitable for unstable network conditions.

1.1.  Terminology

   Peer:         An endpoint participating in the connection (Client or Server)

   Session:      A logical connection state established between two Peers

   Sequence ID:  An increasing identifier for every packet sent

   Order ID:     An increasing identifier for packets within a specific ordered
                 channel

   ACK:          Acknowledgment of a received packet

2.  Packet Structure

   All rtntp packets share a common fixed-size header followed by a
   variable-length payload. Multi-byte integer are transmitted in Network Byte
   Order (Big Endian).

2.1.  Header Format

   The header is exactly 26 bytes long and is packed (1-byte alignment, no
   padding).

   The fields are arranged sequentially as follows:

   Protocol ID (2 bytes):
      Magic number fixed at 0x2204. Used to identify valid rtntp traffic and
      reject random noise.

   Protocol Version (2 bytes):
      Version identifier, currently 0x0002.

   Sequence ID (4 bytes):
      Unique, incrementing ID for this packet. Used for loss detection and
      acknowledgments.

   Channel ID (1 byte):
      The virtual channel (0-255) this packet belongs to. Channel 0 is reserved
      for internal system messages.

   Order ID (4 bytes):
      Incrementing ID for ordered packets on a specific channel. Set to 0 if
      the packet is unordered.

   Acknowledge ID (4 bytes):
      The highest valid Sequence ID received from the remote peer.

   Acknowledge Bitfield (4 bytes):
      A bitmask representing the reception status of the 32 packets immediately
      preceding the Acknowledge ID.

   Message ID (2 bytes):
      Identifies the type of payload (Command). IDs 0-127 are reserved for
      internal use.

   Flags (1 byte):
      Bitmask defining packet behavior (Reliability, Ordering).

   Payload Size (2 bytes):
      Length of the user data following the header (in bytes).

2.2.  Flags

   The Flags field is a bitmask defined as follows:

   Bit 0 (0x01) - kUnreliable:
      Fire and forget delivery.

   Bit 1 (0x02) - kReliable:
      Guaranteed delivery. The sender will retransmit this packet until
      acknowledged.

   Bit 2 (0x04) - kOrdered:
      Guaranteed order. The receiver will buffer out-of-order packets to ensure
      they are processed in sequence.

   Bit 3 (0x08) - kHasAck:
      Indicates that the Acknowledge ID and Bitfield contain valid data.

3.  System Messages

   Packet IDs 0-127 are reserved for internal rtnt packets.

   ID      Name            Desc
   -------------------------------------------------------------------
   0x00    ACK             Header-only acknowledgment
   0x01    RICH_ACK        Contains out-of-band ACKs (old packets history)
   0x02    CONNECT         Client -> Server handshake initiation
   0x03    CONNECT_ACK     Server -> Client handshake completion
   0x04    DISCONNECT      Session termination
                           If received by the Client, the Client considers
                           itself as kicked by the server, and closes the
                           connection.
                           If received by the Server, the Server closes the
                           connection.

  

4.  Protocol Operation

4.1.  Handshake

   1. The Client sends a CONNECT (0x02) packet to the Server.
   2. The Server receives the packet, creates a Session, and replies
      with a CONNECT_ACK (0x03) containing the assigned Session ID.
   3. When client receives CONNECT_ACK, it marks the connection as
      established.

4.2.  Reliability and Acknowledgment

   rtntp uses a selective acknowledgment system piggybacked on every
   outgoing packet.

   - Piggybacking: Every packet header carries the Acknowledge ID (highest
     received ID) and a bitfield covering the previous 32 packets.

   - Retransmission: Packets marked kReliable are buffered by the sender.
     If not acknowledged within RESEND_TIMEOUT (default is 200ms), they are
     retransmitted up to MAX_RESEND_ATTEMPTS times (default is 8).

   - Rich ACKs: If a packet is received that is too old to fit in the 32-bit
     bitfield (out-of-band), the receiver queues it and sends a RICH_ACK (0x01)
     packet containing the list of these old IDs.
     Note: This feature can cause heavy bandwidth usage when the client is
     lagging bad.


4.3.  Ordering

   Sequence IDs are global per session, but Order IDs are local per Channel.
   This prevents a dropped packet on Channel 1 from blocking traffic on Channel
   2.

   - If a received packet's Order ID > Next Expected, it is buffered.
   - If Order ID == Next Expected, it is processed, and the expected
     counter is incremented. Buffer is then processed in order (if there is
     another gap, then wait again).

5.  Serialization

   Payloads are serialized sequentially without padding.

   - Primitive types are converted to Network Byte Order.
   - Strings (std::string) are prefixed with a 2-byte length.
   - Vectors (std::vector) and Deques (std::deque) are prefixed with a 2-byte
     element count.

6.  Security considerations

   - Magic Number: Packets not starting with 0x2204 are dropped.
   - Protocol Version: Protocol version contained in packet is checked and
       rejected if incompatible with local version.
   - Payload size: Packet is dropped if contained packet size doesn't match
       actual payload size.
   - Checksum (not implemented yet): Packets are dropped if checksum doesn't
       match locally computed checksum.
   - Future Work: Version 2.0.0 is scheduled to introduce a dedicated
       security layer including packet encryption and certificate-based
       authentication.

7.  Limits

   - Max Packet Size: 65,535 bytes (limited by u16 size field).
   - Max String, Vector, Deque size: 65,535 bytes.
   - Max Channel Count: 256 (255 for user-defined channels).

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.
